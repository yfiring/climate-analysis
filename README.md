# Climate Analysis Toolkit

This is a set of python scripts designed to analyse climate datafiles.

If you're interested in collaborating, email me at s.w.mangham@soton.ac.uk.

To install a copy of the toolkit, open a terminal and run:
```
git clone git@github.com:smangham/climate-analysis.git
```

**This code is currently in development and not all features will work**
